    <h1>Place of Study</h1>
    <p>Abiazia attended <span class="school">Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic</span>, which is well known for its rigorous academic standards and competitive environment. The institution, while offering a plethora of opportunities for intellectual and personal growth, also posed financial challenges for many of its students.</p>

    <h1>Hardships Due to School Bills and Excessive Payment Demands</h1>
    <p>From the onset, Abiazia's journey at the university was riddled with financial obstacles. The cost of tuition, coupled with additional fees for books, materials, and accommodation, quickly became overwhelming. Abiazia's family, although supportive, struggled to keep up with the mounting expenses. The financial aid offered by the university was limited and highly competitive, often leaving many deserving students without the necessary support. The excessive payment demands extended beyond just tuition and living expenses. Hidden fees for laboratory usage, library access, and extracurricular activities added to the already heavy financial burden. Abiazia found themselves constantly juggling between attending classes, working part-time jobs, and searching for scholarships and grants.
